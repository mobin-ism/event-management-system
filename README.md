# Event Management System

The Event Management System is a backend-focused API designed to facilitate the management of events, attendees, and registrations. Built using NestJS and PostgreSQL, the system supports a wide range of features, including CRUD operations for events and attendees, registration management, and filtering functionalities.

Advanced capabilities include caching frequently accessed data with Redis, background job handling with Worker Threads for email notifications, scheduled reminders using @nestjs/schedule, and real-time updates via WebSocket. The project emphasizes clean, modular, and maintainable code following NestJS best practices, complete with comprehensive API documentation through Swagger.

This system is ideal for handling dynamic event scenarios while ensuring high performance and scalability.

### Real-Time Notifications (WebSocket)

In addition to the RESTful API, the system supports real-time notifications through WebSockets, providing instant updates to clients. The base URL for the WebSocket connection is:

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000`

The server publishes the following events:

- **new-event**: This event is triggered whenever a new event is created. Clients subscribed to this event will receive notifications with the latest event information.
- **event-availability**: This event is triggered to notify attendees when an event is nearing capacity. Clients will be informed that the event space is limited and may be filled soon, allowing them to take action (e.g., register quickly).

Clients should subscribe to these events in order to receive real-time updates during their session.

## Database Schema

### **Event**

The `Event` entity is used to define events, including their name, description, date, location, and max attendees.

| Column Name    | Data Type      | Constraints              | Description                                |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `id`           | `uuid`         | Primary Key              | Unique identifier for each event.          |
| `name`         | `varchar(255)` | Not Null                 | Name of the event.                         |
| `description`  | `text`         | Nullable                 | Optional description of the event.         |
| `date`         | `date`         | Not Null                 | The date of the event (no time).           |

| `createdAt`    | `timestamp`    | Not Null, Auto-Generated | Timestamp when the event was created.      |
| `updatedAt`    | `timestamp`    | Not Null, Auto-Generated | Timestamp when the event was last updated. |

### **Indexes & Constraints**

- **Unique Constraint:** (`location`, `date`) ‚Äî Ensures that each event has a unique combination of location and date.
- **Index:** (`location`, `date`) ‚Äî Improves query performance for filtering events by location and date.

### **Relations**

- **One-to-Many with `Registration`:**
    - The `Event` entity has a one-to-many relationship with the `Registration` entity.
    - A single event can have many registrations (attendees).
    - The `Registration` entity has a foreign key to the `Event` entity.

---

### **Attendee**

The `Attendee` entity is used to define event attendees, including their name, email, and their relation to the `Registration` entity.

| Column Name | Data Type      | Constraints              | Description                                   |

| `createdAt` | `timestamp`    | Not Null, Auto-Generated | Timestamp when the attendee was created.      |
| `updatedAt` | `timestamp`    | Not Null, Auto-Generated | Timestamp when the attendee was last updated. |

### **Relations**

- **One-to-Many with `Registration`:**
    - The `Attendee` entity has a one-to-many relationship with the `Registration` entity.
    - A single attendee can have multiple registrations (one for each event they attend).
    - The `Registration` entity has a foreign key to the `Attendee` entity.

### **Indexes & Constraints**

- **Unique Constraint:** `email` ‚Äî Ensures that each attendee's email address is unique.
- **Index:** (`name`, `email`) ‚Äî Improves query performance for searching attendees by name and email.

---

### **Registration**

The `Registration` entity is used to store the registration details for an attendee to a particular event.

| Column Name    | Data Type   | Constraints              | Description                                              |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`           | `uuid`      | Primary Key              | Unique identifier for each registration.                 |
| `eventId`      | `uuid`      | Not Null, Foreign Key    | The ID of the event to which the attendee is registered. |
| `attendeeId`   | `uuid`      | Not Null, Foreign Key    | The ID of the attendee who is registered.                |
| `registeredAt` | `date`      | Not Null                 | The date when the attendee registered for the event.     |
| `createdAt`    | `timestamp` | Not Null, Auto-Generated | Timestamp when the registration was created.             |
| `updatedAt`    | `timestamp` | Not Null, Auto-Generated | Timestamp when the registration was last updated.        |

### **Relations**

- **Many-to-One with `Event`:**

    - The `Registration` entity has a many-to-one relationship with the `Event` entity.
    - Each registration belongs to a single event.
    - The `Event` entity has a one-to-many relationship with `Registration`.

- **Many-to-One with `Attendee`:**
    - The `Registration` entity has a many-to-one relationship with the `Attendee` entity.
    - Each registration belongs to a single attendee.
